## Description

LiteCode is a lightweight yet powerful IDE that runs inside your browser. You can use it to develop React apps. It's similar to replit or CodeSandBox, but specifically optimized for React. Once you write out the code, it will be automatically transpiled, bundled, executed and previewed all inside your browser. What makes LiteCode unique is its ability to dynamically import any package from npm. Yes, you can use external packages without having to install them. This process is powered by esbuild, which makes it extremely fast. 

But that's not all. LiteCode comes with its own virtual file system. You can create as many files, folders or directories as you like and download them to go as a zip file. It's built to support React apps of any size.   

LiteCode is built using React, TypeScript, Redux, TailwindCSS, Monaco Editor and ESBuild.
